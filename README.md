# Petri-Nets
This is a brief project (and tutorial) on petri nets.

The aim of this project is to learn about concurrency issues by performing investigations with a Petri Net tool such as CPN Tools or PIPE.
1. Title Slide.
2. Technology Platform.
3. Definition of a basic Petri Net.
4. Terminology: Marking, state space, reachability set, non-determinism.
5. A fork and join example before transition firing.
6. A fork and join example after transition firing.
7. Definition of the deadlock problem.
8. A Petri Net for illustrating deadlock with an initial marking of tokens.
9. A Petri Net for illustrating deadlock after several steps have been executed.
10. Definition of the starvation problem.
11. A Petri Net illustrating starvation with an initial marking of tokens.
12. A Petri Net illustrating starvation after several steps have been executed.
13. Definition of the Producer-Consumer problem.
14. A Petri Net illustrating a solution to the Producer-Consumer problem.
â€¢ Figure A1 Producer-Consumer Problem Buffer Size of Three
15. A Petri Net illustrating Producer-Consumer after several steps have been executed.
16. Definition of the Dining Philosophers problem.
17. A Petri Net illustrating a solution to the Dining Philosophers problem.
18. A Petri Net illustrating Dining Philosophers after several steps have been executed.

For displaying and modifying the petri-net models please do so in the PIPE tool downloaded from: https://sarahtattersall.github.io/PIPE/ (if you have MacOS). Should you have windows you can use CPN tools which is much easier (and your figures will be much nicer than mine!)
